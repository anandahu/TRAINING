GEN AI AND CYBERSECURITY

1. üîê ‚ÄúGenerative AI for Automated Threat Intelligence Summarization‚Äù
Why it‚Äôs hot: SOC analysts drown in data. Use LLMs to summarize real-time threat feeds, CVEs, and security blogs into actionable insights.
Use GenAI to:
Auto-summarize threat reports (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, US-CERT)
Create daily threat briefings
Tools: GPT-4, LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers
Impact: Speeds up threat response & situational awareness


Security analysts are overwhelmed by the volume of threat intelligence available across
multiple platforms, including vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD), security blogs, advisories (e.g., US-CERT), and social media. 
Extracting meaningful, timely, and actionable insights from unstructured text sources is inefficient and leads to delayed or missed 
responses to critical threats. There is a need for an automated, intelligent system that can ingest this vast data, understand it contextually, 
and generate human-readable summaries that support faster incident response and risk mitigation.

2. üé£ ‚ÄúAI-Generated Phishing Attacks: Detection and Defense using LLMs‚Äù
Why it‚Äôs critical: LLMs like ChatGPT can craft highly convincing phishing content‚Äîuse adversarial GenAI to detect and defend.

Use GenAI to:
Generate synthetic phishing emails
Train classifiers with hard examples
Tools: GPT-4, fine-tuned BERT/XLNet

‚ùó Problem Statement:
Traditional phishing detection systems often rely on static rules, blacklists, or keyword matching, which are easily bypassed by human-like, 
AI-generated content. With the rise of LLMs capable of producing highly convincing and personalized
phishing emails, existing detection tools are becoming inadequate. There is an urgent need for a dynamic
system that can both simulate advanced phishing attacks and improve defenses through AI-powered training and real-time detection mechanisms.

üß† ‚ÄúUsing LLMs to Detect Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Attempts in AI Systems‚Äù
Why it‚Äôs new: Prompt injection is a serious LLM attack vector (e.g., jailbreaking ChatGPT).
Use GenAI to:
Simulate and detect prompt injection attacks
Build a prompt filter/sanitizer
Tools: GPT-4, OpenAI Moderation API, prompt engineering
Impact: Securing AI apps from malicious prompt use

‚ùó Problem Statement:
As LLM-based AI systems become widespread, malicious actors exploit prompt injection vulnerabilities to subvert content filters and generate harmful or unauthorized responses. 
Existing safety mechanisms are limited in detecting cleverly disguised injection attempts that blend seamlessly with normal input.
This poses a critical challenge in securing AI applications, requiring intelligent detection and filtering mechanisms that understand subtle contextual manipulations. 
The project focuses on developing an automated solution to identify, flag, and neutralize prompt injection and jailbreak attacks in real-time.
